    "<p style=\"font-size:18px\">\tTravel and tourism is one of Texas’s biggest economic drivers, generating $80.2 billion in direct spending in 2018 [1]. People from all over the world flock to experience the unique culture and experience that the Lone Star State has to offer. Austin is one of the most tourist-friendly and famous cities in Texas. Austin hosts some of the most popular music festivals in the country like SXSW and the Austin City Limits Music Festival and is also home to the Circuit of The Americas. Because of the breadth of activities and experiences people can partake in, Austin draws in approximately 24.7 million domestic visitors each year [2].</p>\n",
    "\t<p style=\"font-size:18px\">Like many other cities, Austin is also home to some incredible restaurants. Tourists can indulge in unique cuisines all over the city and make their trip even more memorable. In this analysis, we are seeking to cluster the various neighborhoods in Austin by the types of restaurants they most frequently offer to understand what regions of Austin offer the most options of a specific type of cuisine. Then, we will be identifying the 5 most highly rated restaurants of the most popular cuisine for each cluster of neighborhoods in Austin to create a “must-go” restaurant list. </p>\n",
    "\t<p style=\"font-size:18px\">The stakeholders of this project are the city of Austin and its tourism board as this project will drive heavier tourist traffic around different areas of Austin. Travel bloggers, tourists, and college students will also benefit from this project as they can go to restaurants that are well-liked and experience cuisines that a particular neighborhood is known for. Restaurant owners have a great stake in this project as well because their restaurants may experience heavy foot-traffic because they were represented on this list. Restaurant owners who don’t rank as well may also use this listing and work to improve their rating.</p>"

    "<p style=\"font-size:18px\"> The data required for this project will be collected via web-scraping and by using Foursquare’s API. Web-scraping will be used to create a pandas DataFrame of all of the neighborhoods available in Central Austin. We will then get the Latitude and Longitude values of the neighborhoods using the Nominatim package in python and add those values to our DataFrame. The final data we will be using is location data from Foursquare. We will be querying Foursquare’s API for data on what specific restaurants exist within Austin’s neighborhoods and how well they are rated. This information will be used for determining which cuisines are most popular in which neighborhoods and will allow us to cluster them according to similarity. We will then be able to complete our list of the 5 most highly rated restaurants in each cluster of neighborhoods.</p>"
